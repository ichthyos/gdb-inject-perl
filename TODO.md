### TODO:

- CPANify install, with deps.
- Build system:
	- Doctoc for README(s).
	- Placeholders for project and script name.
	- Deduplication between pod sections and README.
	- Interpolation of longmess so as not to need Carp?
- Enable/disable C backtrace.
- Tests.
- Thread support.
- Execute code from commandline or from file.
- Tablify signal list.
- Stop timeout countdowns when users start entering signals to send? Restart them instead?
- Look into Devel::GDB.
